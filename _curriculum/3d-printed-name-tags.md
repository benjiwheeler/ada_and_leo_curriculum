### Pre-printed 3d nametags welcome students and invite curiosity

### Time: 15-30 minutes

Summary:
--------
Students are each given a 3d printed nametag with their name on it.

This invites discussion about how such an object was created.

Students experiment with simple tools to wear their nametag.


Preparation: (several hours)
-----------------------------------
* set up student accounts in Tinkercad
* create a student nametag in each account
  * use free template:
    * https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2h0eANW57Nj-zora-name
    * or search tinkercad.com for "nametag template with raised letters"
  * save a copy with changed student name
* print the nametags
* login student Chromebooks to Tinkercad accounts

Examining the nametags (5 minutes)
----------------------------------------------
Ask:

* what are these?
* how were they made?
* what do you notice about them?
  * observations to guide students towards:
    * uneven surface, more rough than plastic objects usually are
    * have student names, were made specially for each student
    * back may not be filled in -- why does the front have more plastic?
    * sides -- can you feel with your fingernail that the side feels like it is made of layers, like a stack of paper?

Discussion: 3D printing (5 minutes)
----------------------------------
Ask:

* has anyone heard of 3D printing?
* what could 3D printing be?

Explain:

* normal printing works by putting a line of letters on paper, then another line of letters, then another line of letters, until it's built up a whole page of letters
* 3D printing works by squirting out a thin layer of melted plastic, then another thin layer on top, then another, until it's built up a whole object

Show:

* search youtube.com for "3d printer in action"
* show students video of printer squirting out layers, moving printer head and platform

Activity: How to wear the nametags? (10-20 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------
The nametags don't have an obvious way to be attached to a shirt or bag.

Ask:

* how can we wear the nametags?
* what do you notice about the nametags that might make them easy to wear?
* could you use magnets to wear them?

Provide materials:

* string
* scissors
* safety pins
* binder clips
* paper clips
* scotch tape
* ceramic magnets
  * these cost about $0.20 each when bought in bulk
  * search Amazon for "ceramic disc magnets"
* glue for attaching magnets
  * school glue works well enough
  * several stronger glues work much better, require adult supervision and should not be handled by young children:
  * hot glue gun: the best all-around choice
  * epoxy: must be done in a place where the fumes won't linger
  * "Goop": easier to handle than epoxy, but takes 24 hours to set and must be done in a place where the fumes won't linger

Allow students to experiment with ways to wear the nametags.

Discussion: What makes a good solution for wearing your nametag? (5 minutes)
----------------------
Ask:

What makes a good solution for wearing your nametag?

Is it better if a solution is:
* complex?
* simple?
* easy to explain?

Would glue be a good solution? Why or why not?

Can a method for wearing your nametag be a valuable tool to someone else?

Is it an "invention"? A "technology"?
