section: 3d-printing

### Time: 15 minutes

Preparation:
-----------------------------------
* print the nametags
* set up student accounts in Tinkercad
* login student Chromebooks to Tinkercad accounts

Examining the nametags
----------------------------------------------
Ask:

* what are these?
* how were they made?
* what do you notice about them?
 * uneven surface, more rough than plastic objects usually are
 * have student names, were made specially for each student
 * back may not be filled in -- why does the front have more plastic?
 * sides -- can you feel with your fingernail that the side feels like it is made of layers, like a stack of paper?

Discussion: 3D printing
----------------------------------
Ask:

* has anyone heard of 3D printing?
* what could 3D printing be?

Explain:

* normal printing works by putting a line of letters on paper, then another line of letters, then another line of letters, until it's built up a whole page of letters
* 3D printing works by squirting out a thin layer of melted plastic, then another thin layer on top, then another, until it's built up a whole object

(Optional:) Activity: How to wear the nametags?
--------------------------------------------------
Ask:
* how can we wear the nametags?
* what do you notice about the nametags that might make them easy to wear?
* could you use magnets to wear them?

Provide materials:
* string
* scissors
* safety pins
* scotch tape
* ceramic magnets (NOTE: I should specify which ones)
* glue for attaching magnets
 * school glue works well enough
 * hot glue gun is best
 * epoxy works well but should not be handled by children and must be done in a place where the fumes won't linger
 * goop works well but takes 24 hours to set and must be done in a place where the fumes won't linger

Allow students to experiment with ways to wear the nametags.
