section: 3d-printing
order: 2

### Time: 15 minutes

Preparation:
-----------------------------------
* print the nametags
* set up student accounts in Tinkercad
* login student Chromebooks to Tinkercad accounts

Examining the nametags
----------------------------------------------
Ask:

* what are these?
* how were they made?
* what do you notice about them?
  * uneven surface, more rough than plastic objects usually are
  * have student names, were made specially for each student
  * back may not be filled in -- why does the front have more plastic?
  * sides -- can you feel with your fingernail that the side feels like it is made of layers, like a stack of paper?

Discussion: 3D printing
----------------------------------
Ask:

* has anyone heard of 3D printing?
* what could 3D printing be?

Explain:

* normal printing works by putting a line of letters on paper, then another line of letters, then another line of letters, until it's built up a whole page of letters
* 3D printing works by squirting out a thin layer of melted plastic, then another thin layer on top, then another, until it's built up a whole object

Activity: How to wear the nametags?
--------------------------------------------------
The nametags don't have an obvious way to be attached to a shirt or bag.

Ask:
* how can we wear the nametags?
* what do you notice about the nametags that might make them easy to wear?
* could you use magnets to wear them?

Provide materials:

* string
* scissors
* safety pins
* binder clips
* paper clips
* scotch tape
* ceramic magnets
  * these cost about $0.20 each when bought in bulk
  * search Amazon for "ceramic disc magnets"
* glue for attaching magnets
  * school glue works well enough
  * several stronger glues work much better, require adult supervision and should not be handled by young children:
  * hot glue gun: the best all-around choice
  * epoxy: must be done in a place where the fumes won't linger
  * "Goop": easier to handle than epoxy, but takes 24 hours to set and must be done in a place where the fumes won't linger

Allow students to experiment with ways to wear the nametags.
