Do now: Pass the squeeze!

EACH part of circuit is equally important; if any one disconnects, whole circuit stops. (So, no, you don't ask get a turn being the battery!)

- squeeze flows from left hand to right hand (like negative to positive)
- batteries are where squeeze starts and ends; since electricity flows FROM battery's - end, battery people must face OUTWARDS while wires, lightsnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn etc face INWARDS
- squeezing in series
- break in circuit
- switch (ask 2 kids to connect, disconnect)
- short circuit
- hard vs soft squeezes: just as fast, but less current
- squeezing in parallel: a circle inside a circle


Recap:
We started off by forming a human circuit, squeezing our right hands (the "positive" side) any time we felt a squeeze in our left hands (the "negative" side). We talked about how batteries send electricity out their negative side, while wires, lights, motor, speakers and other circuit components take electricity in their negative side. We activated our circuit in "series", as one big circle, with each person doing something like making a noise when the electricity squeeze came to them. With two of us acting like batteries, we had double the electric current, so we made noises twice as loud! Then we made a "parallel" circuit, which works the way electric outlets in our house work, by forming two circuit loops of people that shared the same battery.
