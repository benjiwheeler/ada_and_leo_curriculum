Splitting Water

There's a basic problem with science in school: most of the time, students are expected to just take their teacher's word that, say, DNA is shaped in a double-helix, or that continents split and merge over hundreds of millions of years. A few of the discoveries of physics and chemistry are reproducible in a 45-minute class session. But even then, science class asks students to just assume the background information about atoms and molecules necessary to explain why it matters that this white liquid plus that white powder equals the large mess that's being called "a volcano".

Isn't the history of science a story of people who refused to accept these assumptions? A new movement of science teachers thinks so, and they are insisting that instead of just broadly learning *what* science knows, students should experience the process of discovering much of that knowledge themselves. After all, the development of the scientific method was not just a shift in practice but a revolution in philosophy. Not only did it cast existing beliefs in doubt, it insisted that we cannot gain knowledge until we realize that we know nothing.

An invaluable introduction to science for a child is for her to conduct, according to the scientific method, an experiment with surprising results. Making a prediction is tied up with ego and pride; to accept that one's prediction was false, and then go right on and find value in the experiment, is a maturing experience. A few science class standards are perfect for this approach; even the much-maligned baking soda and vinegar "volcano" can be revelatory if, instead of hearing the explanation first, students are asked to make predictions, witness the experiment, and speculate as to the results.

One great gem of an intriguing experiment is to run a current through water, and thereby separate water into oxygen and hydrogen molecules. For young students, result makes the later explanation of molecules make sense. For older students, the nuances of charge and ions provide plenty of subtle illustration. And no matter what your age, the result is always remarkeable: where once you had water, now you have separated gasses.

Time: 30 minutes

Materials:

2 "heavy duty" (not alkaline) size C or D batteries
9-volt battery
thin, insulated copper wire
sandpaper
pliers
Total cost: $15

You'll also want on hand:
baking dish, at least 1" deep with flat bottom
2 clear drinking glasses
cardboard or thick paper
plenty of water, filtered if possible
salt
Safety

You will be opening C/D batteries to pull out the carbon rods inside. Opening household batteries is not dangerous as long as they are "heavy duty" or "general purpose," not alkalines or rechargeables. But there is a thick goop inside the battery, either zinc chloride or ammonium chloride, that is a mild irritant if touched, so you should wear gloves and open the batteries in a well-ventilated area.

1. Extract the carbon rods

Tear off the plastic from the C/D batteries, and pry open the edges at the positive end. Use pliers to grip the end of the carbon rod that sticks out of the battery, and pull it out, twisting the battery while pulling to loosen the rod from the goop.

Once it is out, rinse it, wipe it down and sand it clean so there is no more goop.

2. Wire the rods to the battery

Cut two wires, about 10" each. On each wire, remove several inches of insulation from one end and 1/2 inch from the other end. Wrap the long end tightly around the end of a carbon rod and tape it to maintain the tight grip. Wrap the short end around one terminal of the 9-volt battery and tape it tight as well.

3. Make the salt water

Add one tablespoon of salt to a pot of water and mix well. Pour the salt water into the baking dish so that it is 2/3 full, and into the two glasses so that they are completely full.

4. Invert the glasses

Place cardboard over the glasses. One at a time, invert each glass and quickly place it face down in the baking dish. Once the mouth of the glass is under water, remove the cardboard. Since the glasses will begin with no air inside, the hydrogen and oxygen that will fill them will be pure.

5. Insert the rods

One at a time, place each carbon rod in the water, and lifting up the lip of a glass slightly so that it stays under water, slip the rod under. With one rod in each glass, move the glasses close together so that the electrons don't have far to travel to get from one rod to the other.

(Be sure not to put both carbon rods in the same glass. That would give you a perfect balance of hydrogen and oxygen gas, which is a highly explosive combination.)

Bubbles will begin to form on the rods, floating up and slowly growing the air pocket at the top of the glass.

Don't worry if a blue residue forms--that's just a by-product of the salt and impurities in the water.

What is happening?

Water molecules, H20, contain two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each hydrogen atom would like to separate off, but then it would miss the electron it shared with oxygen. Meanwhile, the leftover oxygen would still have one of the hydrogen atoms attached and an extra electron to spare.

Since electrons carry a negative charge, one of these charged molecule parts, called ions, would be positive and the other negative. The current of electrons between the carbon rods--which travel through the water more easily thanks to the salt molecules--provides a chance for each ion to be satisfied, so the water molecule splits into separate hydrogen and oxygen gasses.

Investigate

Can you guess which carbon rod--positive or negative--will attract the hydrogen ion, and which will attract the oxygen/hydrogen ion? And can you guess whether there will be more hydrogen gas produced, or oxygen gas?

Greater Detail

Since there are twice as many hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms in H20, when these form gas molecules there is twice as much of the gas H2 than the gas 02. Check to verify that one carbon rod is producing twice as much gas as the other.

The OH- ions want to give up electrons, and the positive carbon rod needs electrons, so many OH- ions split up, each releasing an electron for the rod. This leaves atoms that want to form into stable molecules, like water. Since the OH- had even amounts of oxygen and hydrogen, when the new water molecules form there is extra oxygen left over. This oxygen collects in bubbles on the positive rod.

What happens with the hydrogen ion, H+, is simple but fascinating. H+ is really just a lone proton, adrift with a positive charge. At the negative carbon rod, there are lots of extra electrons being supplied. Protons are therefore happy to split from water molecules and form new hydrogen atoms, which collect in bubbles on the negative rod. Amazingly, on your kitchen table, you're actually taking subatomic particles--protons and electrons--and forming them into new atoms.
