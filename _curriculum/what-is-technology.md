Draw a technology
Time: 20 minutes

Discussion: what is a technology?
---------------------------------
* solicit answers and ideas

Activity: draw a picture of a technology that you have used
-----------------------------------------------------------
(after a few minutes:)

* share pictures
  * hold up pictures
  * who sees a technology they've used?
  * how do we think that technology got invented?
    * did it get invented one day by one person, or by a bunch of people?
    * did it get invented just all of a sudden or did it take a long time and a lot of work?
    * did it change over time?
* do new technologies always work right?
  * they "malfunction"
  * when the technology you drew malfunctions, what might happen?

Discussion: what is *not* a technology?

* technologies are:
  * things people invented, because they needed them
  * a technology doesn't need to be related to electricity and screens, it can be anything we invent that we want to be useful
* ...but not everything we make is a technology:
  * a song is not a technology, but a way to record a song is a technology
  * art is not a technology, but paintbrushes and paints are
  * a cookie is not a technology, but a recipe for cookies is

(after a few minutes:)
* share pictures

 * who sees a technology they would like to try?
 * what would happen if they malfunction?

Technology in this class

This is going to be a class about technology, and that means a lot of the things that we're using are new inventions that didn't exist a couple years ago. So do people expect everything is going to go exactly how we planned? No, so if you do something and it doesn't quite work right, don't be sad! It doesn't work because it's new and we're trying to push the envelope. Need better language for this. Try to look at how every malfunction can be surprising, interesting, or even funny. Some of the best inventions ever have come because something didn't work right.
