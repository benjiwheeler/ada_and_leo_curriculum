# 3D Printed Nametags

### Time: 20 minutes

 preparation:
  print the nametags

Discussion: what is a technology?
----------------------------------------------
* solicit answers and ideas

Activity: draw a picture of a technology that you have used
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(after a few minutes:)
* share pictures

Basic thing I wanted to add here is that it's optional to have a whole portion of time set aside for putting on nametags in different ways.
 Materials:
  string
   scissors
    ceramic magnets (which ones)
     glue for attaching magnets
       school glue works well enough
        hot glue gun is best
        epoxy  works well but should not be handled by children
        goop  works well but takes 24  hours to set and must be done in a place where the fumes won't linger
     safety pins
      scotch tape
