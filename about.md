Ada & Leo
---------

Ada & Leo is a kids' tech program focused on learning and creativity!

The program was founded in 2015 in Brooklyn, New York, by Ben Wheeler.

This curriculum was developed by Ben, Audrey Fox, Ayodamola Okunseinde, and
the many students who participated in the program and gave feedback.

The name
--------

We are called "Ada & Leo" because we see ourselves as creative engineers
in the tradition of Ada Lovelace (the first computer programmer, who
envisioned computers becoming creative) and Leonardo da Vinci
(who mixed art, invention, and design).
